## Events
### Approval(address,address,uint256)


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **owner** *of type `address`*
2. **spender** *of type `address`*
3. **value** *of type `uint256`*

--- 
### Transfer(address,address,uint256)


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **from** *of type `address`*
2. **to** *of type `address`*
3. **value** *of type `uint256`*


## Methods
### increaseApprovalAndCall(address,uint256,bytes)
>
> Addition to StandardToken methods. Increase the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender and execute a call with the sent data. approve should be called when allowed[_spender] == 0. To increment allowed value is better to use this function to avoid 2 calls (and wait until the first transaction is mined) From MonolithDAO Token.sol


**Execution cost**: No bound available

**Attributes**: payable


Params:

1. **_spender** *of type `address`*

    > The address which will spend the funds.

2. **_addedValue** *of type `uint256`*

    > The amount of tokens to increase the allowance by.

3. **_data** *of type `bytes`*

    > ABI-encoded contract call to call `_spender` address.


Returns:


1. **output_0** *of type `bool`*

--- 
### allowance(address,address)
>
> Function to check the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender.


**Execution cost**: less than 972 gas

**Attributes**: constant


Params:

1. **_owner** *of type `address`*

    > address The address which owns the funds.

2. **_spender** *of type `address`*

    > address The address which will spend the funds.


Returns:

> A uint256 specifying the amount of tokens still available for the spender.

1. **output_0** *of type `uint256`*

--- 
### transfer(address,uint256)
>
> Transfer token for a specified address


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **_to** *of type `address`*

    > The address to transfer to.

2. **_value** *of type `uint256`*

    > The amount to be transferred.

--- 
### approve(address,uint256)
>
> Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of msg.sender. Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729


**Execution cost**: less than 22332 gas

Returns:


1. **output_0** *of type `bool`*

### approveAndCall(address,uint256,bytes)
